Robotic overlords, or getting out from under the Man?
A large and growing minority of people would rather have AI as managers.
A recent Canadian research study by Intentions and Nicholas Badminton has asked some interesting questions, learning that there is a techno-utopian appeal to the role that AI might play in the future workplace.
The study, which surveyed 2299 adults across Canada, found that a quarter (26%) of Canadian adults believe an unbiased computer program would be more trustworthy and ethical than their workplace leaders and managers.
Among Canadians aged 20–39 even a higher number — 31% — agreed that AI might make better managers than humans.
It appears that there is a growing awareness of cognitive bias built into human minds, and in many scenarios in particular workers would rather get people out of the loop.
Challenging the current workplace reality, a quarter (26%) of Canadian adults would prefer to be screened and hired, or have their job performance assessed, by an unbiased computer program. For younger adults those numbers were significantly higher, with 34% preferring to be hired, 33% preferring to be assessed, and 26% preferring to be managed by an unbiased computer program.
The implications are pretty sweeping. If this is a growing generational trend — as suggested by the generational spread — then in the not-too-distant future workers might opt to rely on robotic overminds to manage their companies, hire, fire, and promote. If they are allowed to.
