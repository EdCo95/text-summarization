Rio Olympics 2016: Helen Glover and Heather Stanning win rowing gold
Great Britain's Helen Glover and Heather Stanning successfully defended their Olympic gold by winning the women's pair at Rio 2016.

The world champions, who won Britain's first gold of the London Games in 2012, led from the start as they finished 1.2 seconds clear of New Zealand with a time of 7:18.29s.

Denmark finished third to take bronze.

It was Great Britain's 17th medal of the Games and moved them up to fourth in the table, ahead of Australia.

Glover and Stanning are now unbeaten in 39 races, a run that stretches back five years.

"The pressure was immense," said Glover.

"London was a home games and there was nothing more special but this is defending a title - it means so much."
