Starbucks has more customer money on cards than many banks have in deposits
Most transactions take place using the Starbucks card or the app
Some people keep their money in banks.


Some keep cash beneath a mattress.


Now theres another place that people are depositing their money: their Starbucks accounts.


The Wall Street Journal recently reviewed data from S&P Global Market Intelligence to determine where people are stashing their money these days, including banks, entities like PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, -0.34%  and other nonbanks.


Starbucks Corp. SBUX, -1.06%  , for one, had $1.2 billion loaded onto Starbucks cards and the Starbucks mobile app as of the first quarter of 2016, according to the data.


This money can be used to purchase items including drinks, food and other merchandise.


As of the second quarter of fiscal 2016, 41% of Starbucks transactions in the U.S. and Canada were conducted using a Starbucks card (24% of transactions at company-operated retail stores U.S. used the Starbucks mobile app), according to figures Starbucks provided to MarketWatch.


The company had 12 million active loyalty members in the U.S. in the second quarter.


Starbucks sells millions of gift cards on Christmas Eve alone, a Starbucks representative told MarketWatch during the 2015 holiday shopping season.


The Starbucks figure exceeds the deposits at many actual financial institutions, including California Republic Bancorp CRPB, +0.00% ($1.01 billion), Mercantile Bank Corp. MBWM, -0.04%  ($680 million) and Discover Financial Services DFS, -0.43%  ($470 million).


It far exceeds Green Dot Corp. GDOT, +0.09%  , among the largest prepaid-card providers, with its $560 million on deposit.


Such prepaid cards, the Wall Street Journal notes, are often used by consumers who dont have traditional bank accounts.


PayPal had $13.02 billion in global customer account balances as of the first quarter of this year.


At the top of the Wall Street Journal list is Bank of America Corp. BAC, +0.40%  , with $427.19 billion on deposit, followed by J.P Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.14%  , with $383.28 billion, and U.S. Bancorp USB, +0.30% , with $80.27 billion.


J.P. Morgan has partnered with companies including Starbucks to enable payments through the ChasePay mobile wallet.


At the bottom of the Journal rankings is Beneficial Bancorp Inc. BNCL, -0.14%  , with $410 million.


Starbucks shares were up nearly 0.4% in Thursday afternoon trading and are up 7.4% in the past year.


The S&P 500 is up 1.6% in the last 12 months.
