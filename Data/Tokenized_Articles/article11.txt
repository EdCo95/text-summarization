1The So-Called Alien Megastructure Just Got Even More Mysterious

Last fall, a little-known star called KIC 8462852 became our planetary obsession when astronomers said that its erratic flickering could be the result of an alien megastructure.


1Further observation of Tabbys Star yielded no signs of aliens, but the sudden dips in luminosity continue to defy explanation.


1Now, things just got a bit weirder.


In an unpublished paper posted today to arXiv, Caltech astronomer Ben Montet and Joshua Simon of the Carnegie Institute describe the results of a new photometric analysis of Tabbys Star, which was first flagged in the Kepler Space Telescopes database by citizen science astronomers.


1By carefully examining all the full-frame images collected during Keplers observational campaign, Montet and Simon discovered something astonishing: Not only did the stars light output occasionally dip by up to 20 percent, its total stellar flux diminished continuously over the course of four years.


1For the first 1000 days of Keplers campaign, Tabbys Star decreased in luminosity by approximately 0.34 percent per year.


1For the next 200 days, the star dimmed more rapidly, its total stellar flux dropping by 2 percent before leveling off.


1Overall, Tabbys Star faded roughly 3 percent during the four years that Kepler stared at it an absolutely enormous, inexplicable amount.


1The astronomers looked at 500 other stars in the vicinity, and saw nothing else like it.


The part that really surprised me was just how rapid and non-linear it was, Montet told Gizmodo.


We spent a long time trying to convince ourselves this wasnt real.


We just werent able to.


This isnt the first time astronomers have claimed that Tabbys Star is fading.


Earlier this year, Bradley Schaefer of Louisiana State University decided to examine the star in old photographic plates of sky dating back to the 19th century.


1He found that over the past 100 years, the stars total light output has diminished by a whopping 19 percent.


But shortly after publishing his claims, other astronomers started poking holes in them, saying that the observed dimming was the result of flawed data.


Schaefer pushed back, and things got a little bit ugly.


The controversy over Schaefers work is what prompted Montet to look for long-term trends in another way.


We realized that in order to settle this, you needed either a long baseline, or high precision data, Montet said.


Kepler has the latter.


Montet added that the rate of dimming he measured in the Kepler data is about twice what Schaefer found, which is different, but not necessarily inconsistent.


Jason Wright, the Penn State astronomer who first suggested that Tabbys Star might be the site of a vast alien construction project, agreed that the new analysis lends credibility to Schaefers claim of century-long dimming.


The new paper states, and I agree, that we dont have any really good models for this sort of behavior, he said.


Thats exciting!


Keivan Stassun, an astronomer at Vanderbilt who disputed the idea of long-term dimming, said that Tabbys star continues to defy explanation.


[Montets] intriguing new findings suggest that none of the considered phenomena can alone explain the observations, he told Gizmodo.


In the end, figuring out this puzzle may require accounting for a combination of effects.


1Some of the most credible explanations to date include a swarm of cometary fragments, the effect of a distorted star, or the remnants of a shattered planet.


1Certain things can explain long-term dimming while others can explain short-term flickering, but as Montet put it, nothing nicely explains everything.


1Whats clear is that we arent going to solve this mystery until we get a better look at this star, which is exactly what Tabby Boyajianthe astronomer who first discovered itis gearing up to do.


1Following a successful crowdfunding campaign to secure time at the the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network, Boyajian is going to observe her namesake star for a full year, with the hope of catching it in the act of flickering.


1If that happens, other telescopes around the world will be alerted and swiftly mobilized.


1Well be able to watch the star wink at us across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and hopefully, decode its message.
