Man held after climbing Buckingham Palace fence

A 22-year-old man has been arrested after he climbed over a security fence at Buckingham Palace, police have said.

The man from Croydon, south London, was arrested in the early hours after he was seen by officers who were monitoring CCTV cameras.

He did not gain access to the palace.

The Met said the suspected intruder had been drinking and that the incident was not thought to be terrorism related.

No member of the royal family was in residence.

A more notable breach was in 1982 when Michael Fagan got into the Queen's bedroom and spent 10 minutes talking to her before she managed to raise the alarm when he asked for a cigarette.
