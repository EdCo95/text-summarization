UK tourism boosted by fall in pound
Flight bookings to the UK jumped since June, driven by the sharp fall in the pound following the vote to leave the European Union.

Overall, there were 4.3% more flights booked to the UK in the 28 days following the vote than last year.

Bookings from Hong Kong leapt by 30.1%, while they were up by 9.2% from the US and 5% from Europe.

Travel researcher ForwardKeys said Brexit had had an "immediate, positive impact" on tourism to the UK.

While the pound has fallen about 13% against the dollar since its peak on 23 June, the day of the referendum, it has also fallen about 10% against the euro.

A lower pound cuts the cost of a holiday for foreign visitors to the UK.

The company said worldwide economic uncertainty, terror attacks in France and Belgium and air traffic disruption also benefitted UK tourism.

Record year
Its figures are backed up by evidence from other organisations.

However, even prior to the referendum, the number of tourists from abroad had risen.

Last year as a whole was a record year for inbound tourism, with 36.1 million visits, up 5% on 2014.

Tourism is the UK's seventh biggest export earner and is the third biggest employer.
