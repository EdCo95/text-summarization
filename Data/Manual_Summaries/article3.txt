Measles Spreading at Music Festivals
Music festivals including Glastonbury have become a hotbed of measles this summer, Public Health England has warned.

It said a "significant number" of cases had been linked to the events, with 36 cases reported in June and July alone.

More infected people are expected to be discovered as the outbreaks are investigated.

People planning to attend other festivals are advised to ensure they are vaccinated against the disease.

Measles is a highly-infectious virus which causes a rash and cold-like symptoms for most people, but it can be deadly.

Public Health England describes festivals as the "ideal place" for the infection to spread because of the large numbers of people mixing together.

"So, if you think you might have measles, please don't go to any of these big events."

The festival outbreaks come as the measles virus is spreading more readily in England.
