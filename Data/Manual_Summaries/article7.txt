Tyrrells crisp maker bought by Amplify for 300m

Upmarket UK crisp maker Tyrrells has agreed to be bought by US snacks firm Amplify in a 300m deal.

Tyrrells' products include potato and vegetable crisps, as well as premium popcorn which it calls "poshcorn".

Amplify will pay Tyrrells' current owner Investcorp about 278m in cash with the remainder in Amplify shares.

Tyrrells was founded in 2002 by potato farmer William Chase who realised that making crisps was more profitable than selling potatoes to supermarkets.

'Stellar performance'
Tyrrells generated approximately 85m in net sales last year and international revenues now account for about 40% of its sales.

The latest deal will see current chief executive David Milner stay on as Amplify's international president.
