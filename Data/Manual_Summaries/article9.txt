Vodafone 'removes' broadband line rental charges

Mobile-phone giant Vodafone claims it is scrapping line rental charges for new and upgrading home broadband customers in the UK.

The move means customers will not be billed the current 18 ($23) monthly charge but only if they commit to an 18-month contract.

They will still get a landline connection and phone number, the firm said.

Prices will start at 22 a month.

However, some experts said the charge is being merged, rather than abolished.

Analyst Paolo Pescatore from CCS Insight said it was a bold move, but that Vodafone now needs to think more about its content provision.

As a relatively small player that has struggled to make much headway with residential customers, it makes sense for the mobile operator to go first and garner the best PR.

It now seems inevitable that the others will follow - and that should help consumers by making the complex deals a little easier to understand.

But the UK's broadband market is already pretty competitive compared with many across Europe - it is unlikely that consumers will find they are paying much less overall.
