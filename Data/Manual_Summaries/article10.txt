UK special forces pictured on the ground in Syria

The BBC has obtained exclusive pictures showing for the first time British special forces operating on the ground in Syria.

The pictures, which date from June, follow an attack by the so-called Islamic State (IS) on the moderate rebel New Syrian Army base of Al Tanaf on the Syria-Iraq border.

The British soldiers appear to be securing the base's perimeter.

According to eyewitnesses, they were there in a defensive role.

But they are carrying an arsenal of equipment including sniper rifles, heavy machine guns and anti-tank missiles.

If IS attacked again they would have been able to put up a considerable fight.

After viewing the pictures of British fighters at the base, the Ministry of Defence said it wouldn't comment on special forces operations.

Their numbers may be small, but on the frontlines in the fight against the Islamic State, time will tell if they are making a difference."
