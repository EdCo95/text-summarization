Southern rail strike: Five-day walkout begins

The prime minister "strongly condemns" a five-day strike disrupting services for hundreds of thousands of Southern passengers, Downing Street has said.

Hundreds of trains have been cancelled in a row over plans for drivers, not conductors, to operate carriage doors.

The RMT union claimed "rock-solid support" and said the central issue was safety.

Southern said it was operating nearly 60% of its regular timetable and nine in 10 of those were "running on time".

A spokeswoman admitted 946 of its normal 2,242 services would be cancelled each day during the stoppage.

Southern is the main operator for Sussex and east Surrey with services running to London, Kent, Hampshire and Buckinghamshire.

Southern employs several thousand people.

Just over 300 of them voted for these strikes.

For passengers, things could get a lot worse.

More than 1,000 platform staff are currently balloting for strike action over the closure of some ticket offices and a new role of "station host".

On top of that, Southern still has a chronic shortage of train crew.

And that emergency timetable will continue for at least another month.

No trains are running between:
Havant - Chichester
Horsham - Dorking
Redhill - Tonbridge
Haywards Heath - Seaford (buses between Lewes and Seaford)
Oxted - Uckfield
Preston Park - Hove
Eastbourne - Ashford International via Hastings (peak hours buses between Hastings and Ashford International)
Tulse Hill - West Norwood
Other lines have a "significantly reduced service" between 07:30 and 18:00 only:
Chichester - Three Bridges
London Victoria - Three Bridges
Brighton - Eastbourne
London Bridge - East Grinstead
Brighton - Littlehampton/Bognor Regis
