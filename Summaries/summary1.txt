 A plaque mysteriously appeared overnight outside Bristol's children hospital 18 months ago. The sign claims the giant coloured rings outside the hospital are in fact the 1998 Quidditch World Cup goal posts, dedicated to the children of Bristol. Thousands of "muggles" see the plaque every week but in all that time, the hospital had no idea it was even there. The plaque claims the rings were enchanted by Adou Sosseh, the captain of Senegal's Quidditch team which lost the 1998 World Cup to Malawi. The hospital has now said it will keep the plaque but asks that other "magical beings" who want to put up plaques ask permission first so "muggles" at the hospital can thank them and maintain them.
