 Treating alcoholics - with wine

The recommended treatment for chronic alcoholism is abstinence. But at the Oaks - a permanent home for those who once lived on the streets - residents are given a measure of wine at hourly intervals. It is called the Managed Alcohol Program, and aims to change the drinking behaviour of inveterate addicts. A measure of Californian white - 13% alcohol, made on the premises - is measured into a jug from a draft tap behind the counter. One at a time, the wine is dispensed to nearly 50 alcoholics. For the first pour at 7.30am, most residents get a kickstarter of 7oz - nearly 200ml, a larger-than-average sized glass of wine in Europe. He is from Pond Inlet, an Inuit town in Canada's north, and has been drinking for 40 of his 53 years - a life blighted by alcohol. "It doesn't happen very often, but if they're drunk, I ask them to go to their room and take a nap," says Lucia Ali, one of the frontline staff at the Oaks who works the bar. Ottawa's Managed Alcohol Program - or MAP - was designed to address the needs of homeless people who had tried to stop drinking and failed. "The thought was that if we could stabilise the craziness of their lives, the day that begins with the search for alcohol and all the complications that occur with that, then maybe we could make inroads with their mental health, addiction to alcohol and their physical illnesses," says Dr Jeff Turnbull, one of those early innovators, and the chief of staff at Ottawa Hospital. So we said, wouldn't it be safer if we just got him some wine and allowed him to drink that? There are some proponents who feel so strongly about abstinence as the only treatment for alcoholism, they just couldn't see an alternative." After collecting their drinks from the counter, they amble into the common area, or take their drinks to the courtyard outside and light up a cigarette. "I'd say a minimum of half a dozen times a shift we get calls like this one," says Sgt Boucher. Lifelong alcoholics are an enormous drain on public resources. "One of our clients was in the emergency department 191 times in the six months preceding coming onto the MAP," says Dr Turnbull. No one study about the MAP has crunched the numbers fully, but it is not unrealistic to assume that the city of Ottawa has saved millions of dollars. "There's a profound reduction in 911 calls, hospital emergency visits, paramedic and police encounters," says Dr Turnbull. Before being accepted, potential residents must prove they can live within the rules of the Managed Alcohol Program. Hearing of the death of someone from alcoholism had been a wake-up call. Corinne Jackson has lived here for nearly six years, but she is not waiting in line. Corinne's partner lives at the Oaks with her - he stopped the hourly pour last year.
